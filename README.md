# stock_performance_dashboard
For this project, I will assume the role of a Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data, I will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
Individual investors using the forum on the Reddit online community named WallStreetBets, started buying into shares of GameStop, a video and computer-game retailer losing money. The influx of demand caused GameStop shares to soar.  All this produced billions of dollars in losses for hedge funds who had sold the stock short. GameStop's share price should fall eventually, so the Hedge funds should hold on to the short positions. As a data scientist working for a hedge fund, you will extract the profit data for Tesla and GameStop and build a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the profit for the hedge fund.
